# Voice-based-email-for-visually-impaired

Drisht-E is a web-based application for visually impaired people, thus enabling everyone to control their mail accounts using their voice only and to be able to read, compose and send mail along with some other useful tasks. In this, the system prompts the user with voice commands to perform a certain action and the user responds to the same.
